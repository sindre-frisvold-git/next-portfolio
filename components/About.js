      <p>
        Hi, I am Sindre, a software developer with a passion for problem solving
      </p>
      <p>
        I am experienced with full-stack development and love to experiment with
        new technologies. I am a quick study.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to tech, I have a background in healthcare, management and
        leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time you might find me in the surf, dangling from a boulder
        or indulging in my latest video game obsession.

      <p>
        Hi, I am Sindre, a software developer with a passion for problem solving
      </p>
      <p>
        I am experienced with full-stack development and love to experiment with
        new technologies. I am a quick study.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had a strong interest in tech from a young age through my dadâ€™s
        career as a systems engineer and my obsession with challenging puzzle
        games and physics simulators. An insatiable curiosity for how everything
        works has continued to stoke that flame.
      </p>
      <p>
        I explicitly remember the joy as a young child reading through the
        documentation of the level editor of one of my favourite video games,
        working hard to get it running in the command line interface through
        sheer grit. My path in life led to the healthcare sector and I only
        dared look at programming during one of the lockdowns, but I knew
        instantly, this is what I was made to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to healthcare and tech, I have a background in management
        and leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time you might find me in the surf, dangling from a boulder
        or indulging in my latest video game obsession.
